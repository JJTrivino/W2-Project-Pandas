The goal of this project is start from scratch from a database, perform different data cleaning algorithms, elaborate an initial hypothesis and create a study that proves through the magic of data and statistics if this hypothesis is true or not.

I will use as main tool python, Jupyter Notebook, using visualization tools such as Seaborn and I will be using various statistical analysis techniques to draw conclusions from the data sets.

- The dataset that I will use and on which I will focus our study is table of shark attack incidents compiled by the Global Shark Attack File: Please see [their website] for more details on where this data comes from. {http://www.sharkattackfile.net/index.htm}

-  25723 rows Ã— 24 columns this has been our first challenge.

To clean the data we have used and created functions such as:
- Removal of null values.
- Deletion of columns
- Duplicate elimination
- Functions using apply.
- and many more!
